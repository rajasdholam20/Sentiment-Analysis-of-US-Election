Sentiment Analysis of US Election
This notebook is designed to analyze the sentiment of public opinion regarding U.S. election-related topics by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It provides a step-by-step guide for collecting, processing, and analyzing text data to gauge the sentiment of various stakeholders in the political landscape. The notebook is structured to support multiple objectives, including sentiment classification of texts related to candidates, policies, and other relevant election issues.

Key Components:
Data Collection: Sources election-related data from platforms such as social media, news sites, or user-provided datasets. The dataset includes comments, tweets, or articles with potential relevance to the U.S. election context.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the text data by removing unnecessary characters, stop words, punctuation, and other noise. Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization are applied to standardize the input text.
